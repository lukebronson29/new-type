## About the Project

This digital exhibition is part of an individual undergraduate assignment at Florida Gulf Coast University in HIS3080: Archiving History. Comprising it are sixteen photographs (including both black&white and color) as well as four typed written documents related to Collier County, Florida, throughout the middle of the twentieth-century. All present materials have been graciously provided to the creator of the exhibition, Luke Bronson, by Professor Vic Jones, and courtesy of Collier County Museums and the Collier County Historical Society.

## The Collection

Collier County is on the Southwest coast of Florida, and was officially established in 1923. Its partition from Lee County came off the heels of private development spurts throughout the early 20th​ century, due largely in part to investors’ interest in the coastal area’s potential for seasonal tourism and agriculture. This development continued through the mid-century while the region endured multiple catastrophic weather events, including Hurricane Donna in 1960. The collection on exhibit contains a wide variety of materials related to the aforementioned, and the following sections on this page will guide through this narrative. 

Florida’s development is a strange one, and its southwestern region is no exception. Looking at a map, one can see the unique properties of its location–it is the easternmost landmass in the Gulf of Mexico, is quite close to the island nation of Cuba, is in relative proximity to Central America, and is one of the most southernmost regions in the continental United States. As such, its development coincides with a number of historical trends and events related to the above geographical characteristics. One of the region’s first notable points of interest is Fort Myers, which was constructed during the Seminole Wars of the 1850s and transformed into a small number of permanent settlements over the course of the following decades. It is here where we must acknowledge that the development of Southwest Florida is not simply development, but colonization and displacement. Long before settlers from the North made their way down the panhandle, there were already numerous flourishing Indigenous societies– each with their own languages, traditions, agricultural practices, and a richness of cultures at large. While these Native peoples are unfortunately not featured prominently within the collection, their legacy is evident through namesakes originating in their languages, such as Chokoloskee Island (deemed so by the Seminoles, Chokoloskee means “old house”).

The Naples Pier was constructed in 1888, and travel by boat was the only way to reach the area until the completion of U.S. 41 (also known as the Tamiami Trail) nearly fifty years later. Even though development would become largely dependent on roadways, Southwest Florida did not cease in importance throughout the intervening years. The final years of the nineteenth-century saw the Spanish-American War and Cuba as a primary front. Tampa became the regional headquarters for the United States military, and the transport of raw materials, food and other goods, and the troops themselves relied on a boom in railway expansion. This expansion would continue southward and begin laying the foundation for the coming century, albeit it was not until the roadways were completed well into the 1920s that created the catalyst for the Southwest Florida we have come to know today. 

This collection contains numerous photographs conveying this continued expansion, dating from the 1920s onward. There are crowds of people gathered in empty fields, tractors plowing dirt in front of curious onlookers, and land prospectors in front of a waterway.

We then start to see automobiles, agricultural exhibitions, and county fairs. There is a brewing liveliness to these photos. At the same time, there is a sort of thirst and hunger--a hunger for more land, more industry, more tourism, more capital. As the new inhabitants of Southwest Florida would come to find out, these desires--captivating as they were--were certainly not without risk.

It is impossible to touch on the history of Southwest Florida without discussing the impact of hurricanes. The region’s location on the globe and its tropical climate have historically made it victim to some of the planet’s most destructive natural disasters. Featured prominently in this collection are both photographs and written material about the aftermath of 1960’s devastating Hurricane Donna. 

There are two Fort Myers News-Press front pages, the first covering Donna’s expected landfall in the Florida Keys and a historical record of the damage inflicted by previous storms. The second of these features coverage about the fallout, including damage costs approaching one billion dollars, input from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and even information about the potential spread of typhoid fever post-Donna.

According to editor copies of a few drafted articles about Hurricane Donna and a report from Collier County’s Civil Defense, it was “the most destructive storm ever to hit the United States”.

The accompanying photographs convey the extent of some of this destruction, depicting water up to one’s knees, and survivors traveling by canoe through a waterway in place of what was formerly a neighborhood street. 

Florida Health Notes, a contemporary periodical, covers some of the more bizarre aspects of the post-Donna world in Collier County. In it, we find quoted advertisements for a variety of specialty items capitalizing on the impacted water supply: “Waterless cream-type hand cleaner”, “Disposable Diapers. Selling at discount during present water shortage”, and “Salt water soap. Lathers in sea water. Ten cents a bar. Perfect for ocean bathing!”. 
In addition to a surge in typhoid and subsequent immunizations, the journal also emphasizes a shift in animal activity and a notable increase in the presence of rats and other pests in domestic locations. The impacts of Hurricane Donna came in a multitude of forms, not limited simply to what happened to garner the most traditional media attention.

The few color photographs included in the collection show us life in Collier County (and Southwest Florida as a whole) as we inch closer and 
closer to the present.

Perhaps the biggest outlier in terms of material is a color photograph of a box of tomatoes from “Estrada & Sons Inc.”, and looks to be taken within the twenty-first century. That being said, this photograph serves as a reminder and legacy of the often invisible labor of agricultural workers. While wealthy settlers and “snowbirds” alike may seek refuge from the cold in their coastal oases, Southwest Florida is driven by the labor of migrant farmworkers today, and so too the agricultural practices of the Indigenous peoples who have tended this land for thousands of years.
